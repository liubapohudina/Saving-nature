            <p class="descr">At Saving Nature, we restore links between fragmented habitats to help rescue endangered and
                threatened species from
                extinction. In addition, the forests we create help fight climate change. As the native trees in our wildlife
                corridors
                grow back, they absorb carbon dioxide and create oxygen. Importantly, we work with local conservation groups who
                have
                the knowledge and experience to effectively restore forests, engage with local communities, and monitor results.
        
                The team at Saving Nature selects strategic parcels of land that offer the greatest leverage in connecting
                habitat
                fragments to create viable areas to support biodiversity and preserve critical ecosystems. Notably, these
                connections
                unlock the potential for species recolonization, promote genetic diversity, expand access to resources, and
                reduce
                human-wildlife conflict.</p>
